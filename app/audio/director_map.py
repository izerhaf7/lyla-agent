"""Emotion director map for MiMo voice-clone TTS.

Maps an ``audio_code`` (produced by ``app.api._audio_directive``) to a
``(director, tag)`` pair the MiMo provider threads into its request:

- ``director`` becomes the ``role: user`` instruction telling MiMo *how*
  to speak (BMO persona, emotion, pace).
- ``tag`` is an optional audio-tag prefix (e.g. ``(giggle)``) prepended to
  the spoken text so the same line sounds less monotone.

The seven canonical keys mirror the firmware's ``parse_audio_code``
(``firmware/.../directive_dispatcher.cpp``). Extra "nuance" keys exist for
internal director selection only (reminder pre-synthesis, static assets)
and are never sent to the device as an ``audio_code``.

AR7: this module is pure data + one helper and imports no provider SDK.
