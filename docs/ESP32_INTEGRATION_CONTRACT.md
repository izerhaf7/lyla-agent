# ESP32-S3 ↔ Backend Integration Contract

**Status:** NORMATIVE GROUND TRUTH for Lyla / Taskbot ESP32-S3 firmware.
**Audience:** firmware author, backend operator, dashboard team.
**Supersedes (in case of disagreement):** `docs/PHASE_11_FIRMWARE.md`,
`docs/PHASE_11_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PHASE_11_BACKEND.md`,
`docs/phase-12/ESP_BRIEF.md`, `docs/phase-12/BACKEND_BRIEF.md`.
Those documents remain valid for historical context but where this
document differs, this document wins.

**Companion:** `docs/ESP32_INTEGRATION_ADR.md` — decision log explaining
why each ambiguity was resolved the way it is. Read that file when you
disagree with a choice here.

**Backend baseline:** Phase 12 shipped (`310 passed`). Verified against
`app/api/audio.py`, `app/api/devices.py`, `app/api/_audio_directive.py`,
`app/api/_auth_dependencies.py`, `app/api/audio_tts.py`,
`app/main.py`, `app/schemas/audio.py`, `app/schemas/devices.py`,
`app/utils/audio_validation.py`, `app/config.py` at commit `afbdb7b`.

Protocol version: **`X-Lyla-Protocol: 1`**.

## How to read this document

Sections marked **[NORMATIVE]** are contract. The firmware MUST conform.
Sections marked **[INFORMATIVE]** are background, rationale, or
non-binding examples.

Words in capitals (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY) follow RFC 2119 usage.

Every endpoint section answers four questions in this order:
1. **Path & method** (exact)
2. **Headers in / out** (which are required, optional, frozen)
3. **Body in / out** (schema, with field-level constraints)
4. **Status codes** (which the firmware must distinguish)

If a fact is not in this document, it is **not** part of the contract
and MUST NOT be relied on by firmware.

---

## 1. Identity & deployment posture [NORMATIVE]

| Concept | Value |
|---|---|
| Backend public URL (production) | `https://<your-domain>` (e.g. AWS-fronted) |
| Backend dev URL (LAN) | `http://<lan-ip>:8765` (LAN only, not internet-exposed) |
| TLS termination | external to FastAPI (AWS ALB / CloudFront / reverse proxy / Cloudflare Tunnel). FastAPI itself stays HTTP. |
| Device authentication | `X-Device-Token` header (per-device). See §3. |
| Provisioning | manual SD-card transfer; no BLE, no captive portal. |
| Token rotation | re-pair via dashboard, re-write SD card. No on-device rotate. |
| Concurrency | 1 ESP per `Device` row. No multi-tenant on a single device. |

**The firmware MUST NOT** assume a specific origin shape (LAN vs HTTPS).
It MUST read `base_url` from `/sd/config.json` and treat it as opaque
prefix for every request.

**The firmware MUST** support both HTTP and HTTPS schemes. HTTPS is
production default. HTTP is permitted for LAN development only.

### Why this matters for AWS deployment [INFORMATIVE]

When you deploy to AWS, the typical setup is:
- ALB / CloudFront terminates TLS with an ACM certificate
- FastAPI runs behind on plain HTTP inside the VPC
- Public URL is `https://lyla.<your-domain>` (or `https://<alb-dns>`)
- Operator pairs the device after deployment; the pair response embeds
  `base_url` from `BASE_URL` env on the backend, so ESP picks it up
  automatically without firmware reflash.

The implication for firmware: there is **no compile-time URL**. All
network targets come from `/sd/config.json`. This is intentional so the
same firmware binary runs against `localhost`, LAN, staging, and AWS
production unchanged.

---

## 2. Provisioning & `/sd/config.json` [NORMATIVE]

### 2.1 Operator flow (one-time per device)

1. Operator logs in to the dashboard at the public URL.
2. Navigates to `/devices` → "Pair New Device" → enters a label.
3. Backend issues `POST /devices/pair` (session-cookie gated).
4. Response includes a `config_json` blob (see §2.3).
5. Operator copies the blob, fills `wifi.ssid` and `wifi.password`
   locally, saves the file as **`/sd/config.json`** on a microSD card
   (FAT32, ≥4 GB).
6. Operator inserts SD card, powers ESP on.

The firmware never modifies this file. Token rotation is the operator's
job (re-pair, re-write SD).

### 2.2 File location & encoding

- Path on SD card: `/config.json` (root of the FAT32 volume).
- Encoding: UTF-8, no BOM.
- Line endings: any (`\n` or `\r\n`).
- File size: ≤ 4 KiB (a full-fat config including comments fits well
  within 1 KiB; the firmware MAY reject > 4 KiB as malformed).

### 2.3 Schema [NORMATIVE]

```json
{
  "user_id": "9f58e349-63b2-4f30-8fce-277d8cc670d7",
  "device_id": "34074323-28c8-459c-a005-f9d9b8d26ddb",
  "device_code": "TASKBOT-DEMO-001",
  "device_token": "tk_live_abc123...",
  "base_url": "https://lyla.example.com",
  "wifi": {
    "ssid": "MyHomeWifi",
    "password": "secretpassword"
  },
  "firmware_version": "0.1.0"
}
```

Field-level rules:

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | UUID v4 string | **yes** | regex `[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-...` (36 chars) |
| `device_id` | UUID v4 string | **yes** | same |
| `device_code` | string | **yes** | non-empty, ≤ 64 chars |
| `device_token` | string | **yes** | non-empty; treat as opaque |
| `base_url` | string | **yes** | starts with `http://` or `https://`; no trailing slash |
| `wifi.ssid` | string | **yes** | non-empty, ≤ 32 chars (802.11 limit) |
| `wifi.password` | string | **yes** | may be empty for open networks |
| `firmware_version` | semver string | **yes** | reported back to backend in telemetry |

**Validation on boot [NORMATIVE]:**

If the SD card cannot be mounted, `/sd/config.json` is missing, or any
required field is missing, empty, or fails validation, the firmware MUST:
1. Render the specific SD/config error on TFT (Indonesian: see §11).
2. Enter **degraded offline mode**: keep TFT face rendering, touch, and
   shake behavior alive, but disable WiFi, heartbeat, audio upload, and
   command polling.
3. On PTT press, show the same SD/config error or `Fitur online tidak siap` and
   return to idle. Do NOT attempt WiFi or any network call.

This preserves the "BMO is alive" offline UX while still making it clear
that operator intervention (SD-card replacement/re-provisioning) is needed.

### 2.4 `base_url` policy [NORMATIVE]

This is the **most important** field for AWS deployment. Policy:

- The firmware MUST treat `base_url` as the unmodified prefix for
  every request URL. Concretely: `request_url = base_url + path`,
  with a single `/` between them ensured by the firmware.
- The firmware MUST NOT strip, normalize, lowercase, or re-encode
  `base_url`.
- The firmware MUST select TLS based on the scheme:
  - `http://...` → plain `WiFiClient`
  - `https://...` → `WiFiClientSecure` with `setInsecure()` (MVP) — see §13.
- If `base_url` contains a port, the firmware MUST honor it (e.g.
  `http://192.168.1.10:8765` connects to port 8765, not 80).

### 2.5 Pair endpoint contract [NORMATIVE]

`POST /devices/pair`

Auth: dashboard session cookie (`lyla_session`). NOT a device endpoint.
The firmware MUST NOT call this endpoint. It is operator-facing.

Request body:
```json
{ "name": "Lyla Demo Unit" }
```

Response (HTTP 201):
```json
{
  "device_id": "...",
  "device_code": "TASKBOT-XXXX",
  "api_token": "tk_live_...",
  "config_json": {
    "user_id": "...",
    "device_id": "...",
    "device_code": "TASKBOT-XXXX",
    "device_token": "tk_live_...",
    "base_url": "<from BASE_URL env>",
    "wifi": { "ssid": "", "password": "" },
    "firmware_version": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```

The dashboard SHOULD display `config_json` in a copyable textarea so the
operator can paste, fill `wifi`, and save to SD.

---

## 3. Authentication [NORMATIVE]

The backend has **two distinct token mechanisms** that share the
`X-Device-Token` header name. The firmware MUST send the right token to
the right endpoint group.

### 3.1 Per-device token (audio endpoints)

Used by:
- `POST /agent/audio`
- `GET /agent/audio/{log_id}/tts`

Backend behavior (see `app/api/_auth_dependencies.require_device_token`):
- If `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TOKEN=false` (dev only): no header required.
- If `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TOKEN=true` (production default):
  - Header `X-Device-Token` is required.
  - Value MUST equal `Device.api_token` for some row in the DB.
  - Lookup is by token, not by `device_code` or `device_id`.

The firmware MUST send the value of `device_token` from
`/sd/config.json` as `X-Device-Token`.

### 3.2 Global token (device-management endpoints)

Used by:
- `GET /devices/{device_code}/commands/pending`
- `POST /devices/{device_code}/commands/{command_id}/ack`
- `POST /devices/{device_code}/status`

Backend behavior (see `app/api/devices.require_device_token`):
- Header `X-Device-Token` is required.
- Value MUST equal `settings.device_api_token` (env `DEVICE_API_TOKEN`).
- This is a **single global token** shared across all devices.

### 3.3 1-device MVP convention [NORMATIVE]

For the MVP, the operator MUST configure the backend so that:

```
DEVICE_API_TOKEN == <api_token of the single paired device>
```

This makes the two mechanisms collapse into one usable token. The
firmware sends `X-Device-Token: <device_token from config.json>` for
**every** authenticated request, and both endpoint groups accept it.

This convention is documented and enforced by ADR-11. When the project
moves beyond 1-device MVP, the global `device_api_token` mechanism MUST
be removed in favor of unified per-device lookup. Until then, the
operator-side `.env` setup is:

```bash
# .env (backend)
REQUIRE_DEVICE_TOKEN=true
DEVICE_API_TOKEN=<paste device.api_token from POST /devices/pair response>
```

### 3.4 Header sent by firmware [NORMATIVE]

For every request to:
- `POST /agent/audio`
- `GET /agent/audio/{log_id}/tts`
- `GET /devices/{device_code}/commands/pending`
- `POST /devices/{device_code}/commands/{command_id}/ack`
- `POST /devices/{device_code}/status`

the firmware MUST set:

```
X-Device-Token: <device_token from /sd/config.json>
```

The token value MUST NOT appear in TFT text, serial logs at INFO level
or higher, or any error message. DEBUG logs MAY include the first 6
characters followed by `...` (e.g. `tk_liv...`).

### 3.5 Failure semantics

- HTTP 401 from any of the above endpoints → firmware enters the
  "Device tidak terdaftar" error path (§11), halts main loop, requires
  SD-card re-provisioning.
- HTTP 403 is not used by the backend for these endpoints. If observed,
  treat identically to 401.

---

## 4. Network plumbing [NORMATIVE]

### 4.1 WiFi

- Standard: 802.11 b/g/n on 2.4 GHz only (ESP32-S3 limitation).
- SSID/password from `wifi.ssid` / `wifi.password` in config.
- Connection retry: exponential backoff starting at 1s, doubling, capped
  at 30s. Retry forever; do not give up.
- During retry, TFT shows `WiFi terputus` and the firmware MUST NOT
  enter audio capture or playback states.
- If WiFi was up and drops mid-request, the in-flight HTTP call MUST
  be aborted within 5 seconds and treated as timeout (see §6.4).

### 4.2 TLS

- Production (`base_url` starts with `https://`): use
  `WiFiClientSecure` with `setInsecure()` for MVP. See §13 for the
  trade-off and the post-MVP upgrade path (root-CA bundle).
- Dev (`base_url` starts with `http://`): use plain `WiFiClient`. Do
  NOT instantiate `WiFiClientSecure` for HTTP URLs (wastes RAM).
- Per-request socket timeout: 30 seconds (§6.4 audio, 15 seconds for
  TTS fetch and heartbeat).

### 4.3 HTTP client

- Library: `HTTPClient` (Arduino-ESP32 built-in).
- Connection: keep-alive is OPTIONAL. The backend tolerates new
  connection per request.
- User-Agent: the firmware SHOULD send
  `User-Agent: Lyla-ESP32S3/<firmware_version>`. Backend does not
  inspect this; it is for log triage.
- The firmware MUST NOT send `Cookie` headers. Sessions are
  dashboard-only.

### 4.4 DNS

- Resolved by the underlying WiFi stack. The firmware does not need to
  manage DNS itself.
- If DNS resolution fails (`http.begin` returns false or `http.GET()` /
  `POST()` returns negative), treat as the "Tidak bisa hubungi server"
  error path (§11).

### 4.5 Time-of-day

- The firmware does not need a real clock for the audio request path
  (the backend stamps `request_received_at` server-side).
- For UUID v4 generation in `client_request_id` the firmware uses
  `esp_fill_random` only — no time required.
- If a future feature needs wall-clock time, NTP via `pool.ntp.org`
  SHOULD be added; currently it is out of scope.

---

## 5. Endpoint reference [NORMATIVE]

All paths are appended to `base_url` from `/sd/config.json`.

| # | Method | Path | Used for | Auth header |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | POST | `/agent/audio` | submit recorded voice | `X-Device-Token` |
| 5.2 | GET | `/agent/audio/{log_id}/tts` | fetch dynamic TTS audio | `X-Device-Token` |
| 5.3 | POST | `/devices/{device_code}/status` | heartbeat | `X-Device-Token` |
| 5.4 | GET | `/devices/{device_code}/commands/pending` | poll commands (optional, future) | `X-Device-Token` |
| 5.5 | POST | `/devices/{device_code}/commands/{command_id}/ack` | ack command (optional, future) | `X-Device-Token` |
| 5.6 | GET | `/healthz` | liveness probe (optional) | none |

Endpoints 5.4 and 5.5 are not used by the audio path. They exist for
the legacy device command queue (Phase 7). Firmware MAY skip them in
v1; if used, they share the same header convention.

The `/agent/text` endpoint is **not** part of the firmware contract.
It is used by the dashboard and by `scripts/run_agent_text.py` only.
ESP MUST NOT call it.

---

## 6. `POST /agent/audio` [NORMATIVE]

### 6.1 Path and method

```
POST <base_url>/agent/audio
```

### 6.2 Headers

Request:

| Header | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | yes | `multipart/form-data; boundary=<boundary>` |
| `X-Device-Token` | yes (when `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TOKEN=true`) | `<device_token from config>` |
| `User-Agent` | optional | `Lyla-ESP32S3/<firmware_version>` |
| `Accept` | optional | `application/json` |

Response:

| Header | Always present | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | yes | `application/json` |
| `X-Lyla-Protocol` | yes | `1` (firmware MUST verify) |

The `X-Lyla-Protocol` header is added by middleware in `app/main.py`
on every response whose path starts with `/agent/audio`. Firmware
behavior on mismatch: §6.6.

### 6.3 Multipart body

Fields, in any order:

| Name | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | file | **yes** | WAV PCM 16 kHz mono 16-bit; filename ends `.wav`; `Content-Type: audio/wav` |
| `user_id` | text | **yes** | UUID from config |
| `device_id` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | UUID from config |
| `timezone` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | hardcode `Asia/Jakarta` |
| `client_request_id` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | UUID v4, fresh per request |
| `firmware_version` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | from config |
| `wifi_rssi_dbm` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | integer, e.g. `-55` |
| `battery_pct` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | `0..100`, or `-1` if unknown |
| `recording_duration_ms` | text | optional but firmware MUST send | integer ms from button-down to button-up |

Backend behavior with optional fields: missing fields are stored as
`null` in `VoiceCommandLog.metadata_json`. They never affect the agent
output. Firmware sending them all is required to make
`/observability/*` useful.

Audio constraints:

- Format: WAV PCM 16-bit signed little-endian.
- Sample rate: 16000 Hz.
- Channels: 1 (mono).
- Max upload size: `MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_MB * 1_000_000` bytes (decimal MB,
  default 10 MB → 10,000,000 bytes).
- Allowed extensions on backend (`app/utils/audio_validation.py`):
  `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.webm`, `.m4a`. Firmware uses `.wav`.
- Allowed content types: `audio/wav`, `audio/x-wav`,
  `application/octet-stream` (and others; firmware uses `audio/wav`).

### 6.4 Timeouts and retry

- Socket timeout: 30 seconds. Set on `HTTPClient` via
  `http.setTimeout(30000)` and on the underlying client.
- Firmware-level total timeout: 30 seconds. After that, abort the
  request and enter the "Server tidak responsif" error path (§11).
- The firmware MUST NOT retry `POST /agent/audio` automatically. The
  request creates a `VoiceCommandLog` row server-side (Phase 12 captures
  metadata even on error paths in some scenarios), and silent retries
  produce duplicate logs and possibly duplicate side effects (e.g.
  `create_task` running twice). Recovery is user-driven: user presses
  the button again.

### 6.5 Response body shape

HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/json`. Schema is
`AgentAudioResponse` in `app/schemas/audio.py`:

```json
{
  "reply": "string",
  "actions": [ /* tool result dicts; firmware ignores */ ],
  "device_feedback": null,
  "transcription": {
    "text": "string",
    "mode": "fake" | "gemini",
    "duration_ms": null,
    "confidence": null
  },
  "audio": {
    "filename": "string",
    "content_type": "string",
    "size_bytes": 0
  },
  "tts": {
    "mode": "fake" | "gemini",
    "available": true,
    "content_type": "audio/wav"
  },
  "directive": {
    "audio_code": "ok_expense" | "ok_task" | "ok_reminder" | "ok_summary" | "ok_generic" | "err_generic" | "fallback_tts",
    "face": "happy" | "sad" | "thinking" | "neutral",
    "screen_text": "string or null (≤60 chars)",
    "fetch_url": "string or null"
  }
}
```

**The firmware MUST only act on `directive`.** All other fields are
informational. The firmware MUST NOT pattern-match on `reply`,
`actions`, or `transcription.text`.

### 6.6 Status codes

| Code | Meaning | Firmware action |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | success | proceed to §7 (directive dispatch) |
| 400 | validation rejected (audio empty, bad ext, bad MIME) | err_generic, TFT `Rekaman bermasalah`, → IDLE |
| 401 | missing or invalid `X-Device-Token` | err_generic, TFT `Device tidak terdaftar`, halt |
| 404 | unknown `user_id` or `device_id` | err_generic, TFT `Akun belum siap`, halt |
| 413 | audio file too large | err_generic, TFT `Rekaman terlalu panjang`, → IDLE |
| 422 | malformed multipart | err_generic, TFT `Permintaan ditolak`, → IDLE |
| 500 | agent runtime crashed | err_generic, TFT `Coba lagi sebentar`, → IDLE |
| 502 | STT provider failure | err_generic, TFT `Coba lagi sebentar`, → IDLE |
| (any other 5xx) | server error | err_generic, TFT `Server bermasalah`, → IDLE |
| (any other 4xx) | reject | err_generic, TFT `Permintaan ditolak`, → IDLE |
| (network timeout / no response) | server unreachable | err_generic, TFT `Server tidak responsif`, → IDLE |

In all cases the firmware also verifies `X-Lyla-Protocol: 1` on the
response. Mismatch (header missing or value not `"1"`): treat as the
error path "Versi server beda".

---



## 7. Directive dispatch [NORMATIVE]

The `directive` object is the only contract the firmware acts on. All
fields are server-classified. ESP firmware is a dumb dispatcher.

### 7.1 `audio_code` enum (frozen)

| Value | Triggered by | ESP playback |
|---|---|---|
| `ok_expense` | `create_expense` succeeded | `/sd/sounds/ok_expense.wav` |
| `ok_task` | `create_task` succeeded | `/sd/sounds/ok_task.wav` |
| `ok_reminder` | `set_reminder` succeeded | `/sd/sounds/ok_reminder.wav` |
| `ok_summary` | `get_today_summary` succeeded | `/sd/sounds/ok_summary.wav` |
| `ok_generic` | other tool succeeded | `/sd/sounds/ok_generic.wav` |
| `err_generic` | at least one action failed | `/sd/sounds/err_generic.wav` |
| `fallback_tts` | no actions; agent gave free-form reply | fetch `directive.fetch_url` and stream |

If `directive.audio_code` matches none of these (forward-compat with a
future server version), the firmware MUST treat it as `ok_generic` and
continue. It MUST NOT crash.

### 7.2 `face` enum (frozen)

| Value | TFT rendering |
|---|---|
| `happy` | smile pixmap |
| `sad` | frown pixmap |
| `thinking` | dots animation |
| `neutral` | flat-line pixmap |

Unknown `face` values: render `neutral`.

### 7.3 `screen_text`

- Type: string or null.
- Length: ≤ 60 characters (server already truncates with `…`).
- May contain `\n` for line breaks. Other control characters: render
  as space.
- Firmware MUST treat the string as opaque. No parsing, no regex.
- If `null`: clear the text region of the TFT.

### 7.4 `fetch_url`

- Type: string or null.
- When non-null, format is a **relative path** like `/agent/audio/<log_id>/tts`.
- The firmware MUST construct the request URL as `base_url + fetch_url`
  with exactly one `/` between them (handled by the firmware HTTP
  helper).
- The firmware MUST NOT use `fetch_url` for any audio_code other than
  `fallback_tts`. For all other codes it is `null` and MUST be
  ignored.

### 7.5 SD-card filename mapping

For audio_codes other than `fallback_tts`, the playback file is
`/sd/sounds/<audio_code>.wav`. The 7 files (6 mapped codes + greeting)
that MUST be present on every SD card:

`
/sd/sounds/ok_expense.wav
/sd/sounds/ok_task.wav
/sd/sounds/ok_reminder.wav
/sd/sounds/ok_summary.wav
/sd/sounds/ok_generic.wav
/sd/sounds/err_generic.wav
/sd/sounds/greet_hello.wav
`

Optional filler files (firmware SHOULD play to mask network latency):

`
/sd/sounds/ack_thinking.wav
/sd/sounds/ack_still_thinking.wav
/sd/sounds/ack_slow_network.wav
`

WAV format for every file: PCM 16-bit signed mono. Sample rate is read from the WAV header at runtime, so files MAY be 16 kHz or 24 kHz. The bundled SD pack generated by `scripts/generate_firmware_sounds.py` is **24 kHz** (Gemini TTS native).

If a required file is missing on SD, firmware MUST fall back to
`err_generic.wav`. If `err_generic.wav` itself is missing, or the SD card
is unavailable, firmware MUST emit a short tone or skip playback silently
and continue without crashing.

---

## 8. `GET /agent/audio/{log_id}/tts` [NORMATIVE]

Used only when `directive.audio_code == "fallback_tts"` and
`directive.fetch_url` is non-null.

### 8.1 Path

`
GET <base_url><directive.fetch_url>
`

The firmware MUST NOT construct the path manually from the
`log_id`. It MUST use `directive.fetch_url` verbatim. This keeps
firmware insulated from future server-side path changes.

### 8.2 Headers

Request:

| Header | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `X-Device-Token` | yes (when `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TOKEN=true`) | `<device_token from config>` |
| `Accept` | optional | `audio/wav` |

Response:

| Header | Always present | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | yes | `audio/wav` |
| `X-Lyla-Protocol` | yes | `1` |

### 8.3 Body

WAV PCM 16-bit signed mono. Sample rate is the provider's native rate:

- Fake mode: 16000 Hz (matches `FAKE_TTS_SAMPLE_RATE`).
- Gemini mode: 24000 Hz (Gemini TTS native).

The firmware MUST inspect the WAV header (sample rate field at byte
offset 24) and configure the I2S output accordingly. Hard-coding 16 kHz
or 24 kHz on the firmware side is forbidden.

### 8.4 Timeouts

- Socket timeout: 15 seconds.
- The firmware SHOULD start playing filler audio
  (`ack_still_thinking.wav`) when this fetch begins, to mask Gemini
  TTS latency (~1-6 s).
- If the fetch fails or times out, fall back to `err_generic.wav` and
  return to IDLE.

### 8.5 Status codes

| Code | Meaning | Firmware action |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | audio bytes follow | parse WAV header, stream to I2S |
| 401 | bad token | TFT `Device tidak terdaftar`, halt |
| 404 | cache miss or expired (TTL 300 s) | err_generic, → IDLE |
| (any 5xx) | provider/server error | err_generic, → IDLE |
| (timeout) | network slow | err_generic, → IDLE |

### 8.6 Cache TTL

The backend caches TTS bytes in-process for `TTS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`
(default 300 s). The firmware MUST fetch immediately after receiving
`fetch_url` and MUST NOT defer the GET. Stale `log_id`s return 404.

### 8.7 Buffer-then-play (v1)

The firmware MUST download the full response body before starting I2S
playback. Streaming-while-downloading is intentionally deferred (see
ADR-6). Memory budget: ~12 s of WAV at 24 kHz mono 16-bit ≈ 576 KB,
fits in PSRAM.

---

## 9. `POST /devices/{device_code}/status` (heartbeat) [NORMATIVE]

### 9.1 Path

`
POST <base_url>/devices/<device_code>/status
`

`device_code` is from `/sd/config.json` (URL-encoded if it contains
non-ASCII; the default codes are ASCII-only).

### 9.2 Headers

| Header | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | yes | `application/json` |
| `X-Device-Token` | yes | `<device_token from config>` |

### 9.3 Body

`json
{
  "status": "online",
  "firmware_version": "0.1.0",
  "wifi_rssi_dbm": -55,
  "battery_pct": 80,
  "free_heap_bytes": 234567
}
`

Field rules:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | yes | exactly `"online"` or `"offline"` |
| `firmware_version` | string | optional | from config |
| `wifi_rssi_dbm` | int | optional | from `WiFi.RSSI()` |
| `battery_pct` | int | optional | `0..100`; `-1` if no battery hardware |
| `free_heap_bytes` | int | optional | from `ESP.getFreeHeap()` |

The firmware SHOULD send all telemetry fields. Missing fields preserve
the previous value on the `Device` row (Phase 12 backend is
backward-compatible).

### 9.4 Cadence

| Event | Frequency |
|---|---|
| heartbeat (idle) | every 60 s |
| heartbeat (recording, sending, playing) | paused |
| heartbeat (after WiFi reconnect) | immediate, then resume 60 s cadence |
| `status: "offline"` final beat | optional; firmware MAY skip on power-off |

### 9.5 Response

HTTP 200 with body:

`json
{
  "status": "online",
  "last_seen_at": "2026-05-17T07:12:34.567+00:00"
}
`

The firmware SHOULD ignore the body. Heartbeat is fire-and-forget.

### 9.6 Status codes

| Code | Firmware action |
|---|---|
| 200 | continue |
| 401 | TFT `Device tidak terdaftar`, halt |
| 404 | TFT `Device tidak ditemukan`, halt |
| (other) | log, retry next 60 s tick |

The first heartbeat at boot is special: a 401 here MUST halt the
firmware before the user is allowed to interact (§10.1). Subsequent
heartbeat failures MUST NOT block the main loop.

---


## 10. Boot sequence [NORMATIVE]

The firmware MUST execute these steps in order. A failure at any step
that the table marks **halt** stops further progress.

| # | Step | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Power on, init TFT | halt (no display = catastrophic) |
| 2 | Show splash `Lyla starting...` | — |
| 3 | Mount SD card | degraded offline mode: `SD card error` |
| 4 | Read & validate `/sd/config.json` | degraded offline mode: `Config error: <field>` |
| 5 | Init I2S input (mic) and I2S output (speaker) | mic fail disables online PTT; speaker fail continues visual-only |
| 6 | Init WiFi using `config.wifi` | retry forever, TFT `WiFi terputus` |
| 7 | Send first heartbeat (`status: "online"`) | 401 → halt; 5xx → log, continue |
| 8 | Play `/sd/sounds/greet_hello.wav` | log, continue |
| 9 | Render `face_neutral` | — |
| 10 | Enter main loop (IDLE) | — |

The button MUST NOT be sampled until step 10. Premature button events
during boot MUST be discarded.

### 10.1 First-heartbeat halt

Step 7 is the only network call before the user can interact. A 401
here unambiguously means the SD card carries an invalid token. The
firmware MUST halt with TFT `Device tidak terdaftar` and require
re-pair. This prevents the user from triggering audio captures that
will all fail authentication.

---

## 11. TFT user-facing copy [NORMATIVE]

All TFT messages MUST be in **Bahasa Indonesia**. They MUST NOT
contain HTTP status codes, English error names, stack traces, or token
values.

### 11.1 Frozen message catalog

These messages MUST be rendered on the **TFT screen text region** (the
strip below the BMO face area). Use the firmware's existing
`Adafruit_GFX` text helpers; do NOT switch fonts or render libraries
mid-flight.

| Trigger | TFT text (exact) |
|---|---|
| Boot splash | `Lyla starting...` |
| SD mount fail | `SD card error` |
| Config field invalid | `Config error: <field>` (e.g. `Config error: base_url`) |
| Audio init fail | `Audio init error` |
| WiFi disconnected | `WiFi terputus` |
| WiFi up but online unreachable mid-record | `Tidak ada internet` |
| TLS / DNS failure | `Tidak bisa hubungi server` |
| HTTP timeout | `Server tidak responsif` |
| Bad protocol version | `Versi server beda` |
| 401 from any device endpoint | `Device tidak terdaftar` |
| 404 `user_id` / `device_id` | `Akun belum siap` |
| 404 `device_code` (heartbeat) | `Device tidak ditemukan` |
| 5xx | `Server bermasalah, coba lagi` |
| 4xx (other) | `Permintaan ditolak` |
| Audio validation 400 | `Rekaman bermasalah` |
| 413 audio too large | `Rekaman terlalu panjang` |
| Bad JSON in response | `Respon tidak valid` |
| Missing SD audio file | `File audio hilang` |
| Online disabled by SD/config/audio failure | `Fitur online tidak siap` or the exact boot error |
| PTT cooldown active | `Tunggu sebentar` |
| PTT rate limit reached | `Terlalu sering` |
| PTT input electrically noisy | `Tombol tidak stabil` |
| Recording too quiet / silent | `Suara tidak terdengar` |

### 11.2 `screen_text` rendering

When `directive.screen_text` is non-null, it replaces the static
message above for the duration of playback. After playback ends, the
firmware clears the screen text region and resumes the persistent
offline emotion (per ADR-13). Server-driven `face` overrides also
revert at this point.

### 11.3 Layout & truncation

TFT screen text region is 320 px wide × ~ 60 px tall, below the BMO
face (face ROI defined in `tft_face.cpp`). At the default 6×10
`Adafruit_GFX` font (text size 2 = 12×20 px), one row holds about 26
characters. Server already truncates `screen_text` to 60 chars total
with `…`; firmware honors `\n` for explicit line breaks and SHOULD
wrap on whitespace. Hard truncation past 60 chars is not the
firmware's responsibility.

## 12. State machine [NORMATIVE]

`

`

### 12.1 Concurrency model

The firmware MUST run audio I/O on FreeRTOS tasks separate from the
main control flow:

- I2S input (capture during `[RECORDING]`): high-priority task,
  DMA-driven.
- I2S output (playback during `[PLAYING_RESPONSE]`): high-priority
  task, DMA-driven.
- HTTP I/O (during `[SENDING]` and TTS fetch): runs on the main task
  or a worker task; the main loop polls state.
- Heartbeat: timer-driven (every 60 s), executes on a dedicated task or
  via FreeRTOS software timer. Paused while state is not `[IDLE]`.

Race-condition-prone boundaries (firmware MUST guard with mutex or
queue):
- Filler playback ↔ response playback handoff (don't double-start I2S).
- Heartbeat ↔ active request (heartbeat MUST NOT preempt an in-flight
  `POST /agent/audio`).

### 12.2 WiFi drop during request

If WiFi drops while in `[SENDING]` or while fetching TTS in
`[PLAYING_RESPONSE]`:
1. Abort the in-flight HTTP call (timeout within 5 s).
2. Stop any I2S DMA cleanly (don't truncate mid-buffer; let the current
   buffer flush).
3. -> `[SHOWING_ERROR]` with `Tidak bisa hubungi server`.
4. WiFi reconnect runs in background (§4.1) without firmware
   intervention.

The firmware MUST NOT attempt to "resume" a broken request. Voice
commands are atomic: re-record on next button press.

---


## 13. TLS posture [NORMATIVE]

### 13.1 MVP: `setInsecure()`

For the MVP, when `base_url` starts with `https://`, the firmware
MUST use `WiFiClientSecure` with `setInsecure()`:

`cpp
WiFiClientSecure client;
client.setInsecure();   // skip cert chain validation
client.setTimeout(30000);

HTTPClient http;
http.begin(client, full_url);
http.addHeader("X-Device-Token", config.device_token);
// ... build body, send
`

Trade-off:
- **Pro**: minimal code, no cert bundle to ship, no rotation pain.
- **Con**: vulnerable to active MITM if an attacker sits between ESP
  and the public endpoint (rogue WiFi, ISP tampering). The audio
  payload contains transcribed user speech which is privacy-sensitive.
  Acceptable for MVP. Not acceptable for sustained production.

### 13.2 Post-MVP upgrade path [INFORMATIVE]

When upgrading off `setInsecure()`:

1. Export the AWS-side certificate root CA (Amazon Root CA 1 PEM if
   ALB; ISRG Root X1 if Cloudflare/Let's Encrypt).
2. Embed in firmware as PROGMEM string `rootCaPem[]`.
3. Replace `client.setInsecure()` with `client.setCACert(rootCaPem)`.
4. Optionally pin a leaf cert via `client.setCertificate(...)` (not
   recommended for AWS-managed certs that auto-rotate).

Cost: ~5 KB flash for the CA bundle, ~20 lines of code. Plan to do
this before any production rollout beyond a single demo unit.

### 13.3 Token confidentiality

The `X-Device-Token` is the single secret on the device. Firmware
guarantees:
- MUST NOT print the full token via `Serial.print`.
- MUST NOT include the token in TFT text.
- MUST NOT include the token in heartbeat or error telemetry.
- MAY include the first 6 chars + `...` in DEBUG-level serial output
  for triage (e.g. `tk_liv...`).

If the token is compromised, the recovery procedure is documented in
`docs/PHASE_12_SUMMARY.md` (re-pair via dashboard, write new SD).

## 14. Hardware reference [NORMATIVE for pinmap, INFORMATIVE for the rest]

This section reflects the **actual** Taskbot/BMO ESP32-S3 hardware
(see `taskbot_online_pinmap.md` for full rationale). The pinmap is now
binding because firmware reuses the offline build's wiring; ADR-12
records why this section diverges from the original Phase 11 TFT
suggestion.

| Component | Bus | Pins (final) |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-S3 WROOM (8 MB PSRAM) | — | — |
| TFT ILI9341 320×240 RGB565 | SPI shared | CS=14, DC=21, RST=47, MOSI=1, SCK=2, MISO=41 |
| microSD card | SDMMC 1-bit | CLK=39, CMD=38, D0=40 (Freenove on-board slot) |
| Touch sensor (TTP223) | GPIO | OUT=4 (wake-from-idle) |
| MPU6050 IMU | I2C | SDA=6, SCL=7 (shake-to-dizzy) |
| INMP441 mic | I2S input | WS=15, BCLK=16, SD=17 (3.3 V only) |
| MAX98357A speaker amp | I2S output | LRC=8, BCLK=9, DIN=10 (5 V VIN) |
| Push-to-talk button | GPIO | 18 (`INPUT_PULLUP`, active LOW) |
| Status LED | GPIO | 42 via 220 Ω resistor |

The TFT and the on-board microSD slot use **separate buses**. The TFT
runs on user SPI (MOSI=1, SCK=2, MISO=41), and the microSD uses the
dedicated SDMMC peripheral on GPIO 38/39/40. There is no bus contention
between display refresh and SD I/O. Firmware initializes
`Adafruit_ILI9341` over `SPIClass` and `SD_MMC.begin("/sdcard", true)`
in 1-bit mode independently.

### 14.1 Memory budget [NORMATIVE]

The audio buffer and the TFT framebuffer are the dominant allocations.

| Region | Bytes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TFT framebuffer (`GFXcanvas16` 320×240) | 153 600 | heap; reused by offline + online rendering |
| Audio capture buffer | 960 000 | `ps_malloc` in PSRAM (30 s mono 16-bit @ 16 kHz) |
| TTS playback buffer | up to 600 000 | PSRAM (12 s mono 16-bit @ 24 kHz) |
| Multipart preamble + trailer | ~ 1 500 | heap |
| ArduinoJson document | 4 096 | heap (sized for response shape) |
| TLS handshake buffers | ~ 32 000 | when `WiFiClientSecure` connects |
| FreeRTOS task stacks | ~ 30 000 | 5 tasks at 6 KB each |
| Application + libraries | balance | ~ 100 KB free heap floor |

Hard rules:
- Firmware MUST NOT hold the audio capture buffer and the TTS playback
  buffer simultaneously. Capture buffer is freed before issuing the
  TTS GET. PSRAM peak stays below 1.6 MB.
- The TFT framebuffer is allocated once at boot and lives forever.
  Offline + online rendering both write into this single buffer.
- If `ps_malloc` returns null at boot, firmware halts with TFT
  message "PSRAM tidak terdeteksi" (PlatformIO build flag
  `-DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM` + `-DCONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC` MUST be set).

### 14.2 Power [INFORMATIVE]

USB power, 5 V / ≥ 1 A. MAX98357A draws up to 700 mA at peak. Battery
operation, deep sleep, and brown-out recovery are out of scope.

---

## 15. Versioning [NORMATIVE]

### 15.1 Protocol version

The contract is **protocol version 1**, advertised by the response
header `X-Lyla-Protocol: 1` on every `/agent/audio*` endpoint.

- Schema-additive changes (new optional field, new `audio_code` in a
  way that defaults to `ok_generic`) keep version 1.
- Removing a field, renaming a field, removing or repurposing an
  `audio_code` value, or changing the `directive` shape bumps the
  version to 2 and breaks compatibility.

The firmware MUST refuse to dispatch a directive when
`X-Lyla-Protocol` is missing or not equal to `"1"` (§6.6).

### 15.2 Firmware version

`firmware_version` is a semver string (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). The
firmware MUST report this in every audio request and every heartbeat.
The dashboard uses it for fleet triage.

Bumping `firmware_version` does NOT require a backend change. Backend
treats it as opaque metadata.

### 15.3 Out-of-scope today (frozen)

The following are **not** part of protocol version 1 and the firmware
MUST NOT depend on them:

- Wake-word ("Hey Lyla")
- Continuous / multi-turn conversation
- Real-time streaming audio (WebSocket, WebRTC)
- `POST /devices/{id}/rotate-token` endpoint
- BLE provisioning, captive portal
- OTA firmware update
- Battery sleep / deep-sleep
- Audio compression (Opus, AAC)
- Wake-on-button via ULP
- Voice biometrics

When any of these ship, the document version increments and the
`X-Lyla-Protocol` value MAY change.

## 16. Implementation checklist [NORMATIVE]

The firmware author MUST be able to tick every box before declaring v1
complete.

- [ ] Halt on 401 first heartbeat (`Device tidak terdaftar`)
- [ ] Play `greet_hello.wav` on success
- [ ] Render `face_neutral` and enter IDLE

### Per request
- [ ] Capture mono 16 kHz 16-bit PCM into PSRAM buffer
- [ ] Build WAV header (44 bytes) per §6.3
- [ ] Generate fresh UUID v4 `client_request_id` (RFC 4122)
- [ ] Read `WiFi.RSSI()` for `wifi_rssi_dbm`
- [ ] Read battery (`-1` if no hardware)

- [ ] Pause heartbeat during `[RECORDING]` / `[SENDING]` / `[PLAYING_RESPONSE]`
- [ ] Reconnect WiFi with backoff (§4.1)
- [ ] No retries of `POST /agent/audio` (§6.4)

### Error paths
- [ ] All TFT text in Bahasa Indonesia (§11.1)
- [ ] No HTTP codes or stack traces on TFT
- [ ] No token leakage at any log level
- [ ] All paths (404, 401, 500, 502, timeout, JSON parse) handled
- [ ] Never crash / panic; always return to IDLE or HALTED
- [ ] Audio file missing on SD → fall back to `err_generic.wav`

### Security
- [ ] HTTPS via `WiFiClientSecure.setInsecure()` for `https://`
- [ ] Plain `WiFiClient` for `http://`
- [ ] Token is in PSRAM/heap only, never serialized to TFT or logs

---

## 17. Out of contract / future phases [INFORMATIVE]

When any of these ship, this document gets a version bump and the
firmware contract is renegotiated:

- AWS deployment specifics (DNS, ALB, IAM): operator concern, not
  firmware contract.
- Multi-device, multi-user (per-device tokens replacing the global one).
- Push notifications from backend to ESP (currently command queue is
  poll-based and unused in audio path).
- `DASHBOARD_AUTH_MODE=shared_header` for dashboard ↔ ESP cross-talk
  (the firmware does not call dashboard endpoints).
- Audio retention beyond the in-process TTS cache.
